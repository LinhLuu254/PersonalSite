				<h2>About me</h2>
				<img src="linhluu1.jpg" width= "500" height="600" alt="Linh"></img>
				<p>My name is Linh Luu and i am from Saigon-Vietnam. I am living in a family with five members: my husband, my two adorable kids and my mom. I am a mix between introvert and extrovert person. 
					<br>i love to hang out with my friends and family and we do a lol cooking together. I like to assess the place and situation before speaking. When someone approaches me, I would like to be 
					<br>humble and kind enough to answer their questions. Most importantly, I’m comfortable with people whom I know, so that the information being conveyed will be interpreted easily. While studying 
					<br>or participating in any activities, I try to focus so that my concentration is towards the things that I’m doing. My hobbies are basically: cooking, gardening and singing.
